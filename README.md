# ML-bangla-digit-classification
Similar to MNIST dataset, Ekush is a Bangla handwritten characters dataset. It contains 673,482 character instances and 242 character classes. However, only 15,208 samples representing digits from 0-9 were used in this project.

### Motivation
- Approximately 300 million use Bangla as their native language and another 37 million people speak Bangla as second language. It is the fifth most-spoken native language and seventh most spoken language by total number of speakers in the world. Unfortunately, it has not been explored much in the field of NLP and it is our duty to introduce Bangla to the NLP community so that Bangla speaking people can also enjoy the benefit of AI based products.

### Objectives
- To improve accuracy of bangla digit classification.
